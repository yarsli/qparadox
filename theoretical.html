    <h1>Theoretical Physics</h1>
    <p>
        Step into the realm where mathematics becomes a language of the cosmos and thought experiments shape our understanding of reality. 
        This hub invites you to explore the great frameworks, quantum mysteries, and philosophical puzzles that define the frontier of human knowledge.

    <h2>What is Theoretical Physics?</h2>
    <p>
        Theoretical physics seeks to understand the universe using the language of mathematics and the logic of pure thought. 
        While experimental physics tests nature through observation, theoretical physics builds models and frameworks that can predict what those experiments might reveal. 
        From the timeless laws of motion to the strange behavior of quantum particles, theoretical physics serves as the backbone of all physical science.

    <h2>Core Classical Theories</h2>
    <p>
        Before the quantum age, our understanding of the universe was guided by the great classical theories: Newtonian mechanics, Maxwell's electromagnetism, and Einstein’s relativity. 
        These ideas continue to power our technology and shape our worldview — from predicting planetary orbits to enabling the electricity that drives modern civilization.

    <h2>Quantum Mechanics</h2>
    <p>
        At the atomic and subatomic scales, the rules change. Quantum mechanics describes a world where particles can be in many states at once, where observation influences reality, and where uncertainty is not a limitation but a fundamental property of nature. 
        This strange yet accurate theory powers lasers, semiconductors, and even the algorithms behind quantum computing.

    <h2>Modern & Frontier Physics</h2>
    <p>
        From unifying the forces of nature to exploring the earliest moments after the Big Bang, modern theoretical physics reaches for answers to the most ambitious questions. 
        Quantum field theory, string theory, loop quantum gravity, and cosmology are part of this ongoing quest to weave the small-scale quantum world and the large-scale cosmic structure into one grand theory.

    <h2>Beyond the Textbook</h2>
    <p>
        Hidden within research papers and advanced lectures are concepts that rarely make it to popular science books but are essential to modern physics. 
        These include symmetry breaking, the holographic principle, Berry phases, retrocausality, and the deep problem of time. 
        They reveal not only the complexity of nature but also the depth of our philosophical struggle to define reality.

<section>
    <h2>Physics & Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
        The boundary between physics and philosophy blurs when we ask questions about meaning, causality, and the ultimate nature of reality. 
        Theoretical physics is not just about equations — it’s about interpreting what they tell us about existence, free will, and the possibility that reality is fundamentally mathematical.
