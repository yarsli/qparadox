    <h2 class="section-title">What is theoretical physics</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Theoretical physics is the craft of writing reality in a compressed language. The compression is not just about shorter equations.
      It is about fewer assumptions and cleaner principles that organize many possible experiments at once. A good theory gives you a way to ask
      the right questions and a way to notice when you have fooled yourself. It does not replace experiments. It points to them, shapes them,
      and interprets them. The engine is a cycle. You guess a structure, you translate it into mathematics, you derive consequences, you compare
      with measurement, you keep what survives, and you discard or refine what does not. This is not cynicism. It is respect for the world.
    </p>
    <div class="callout">
      A useful mental model is to separate three layers: principles, models, and calculations. Principles say what kind of stories are allowed.
      Models pick the characters and their relations. Calculations tell you how those relations play out in time and in data. The art is to move
      between these layers without getting lost.

      <!-- Classical Mechanics -->
      <article class="card span-12">
        <div class="badge">Classical</div>
        <h3>Classical mechanics: from forces to actions</h3>
        <p>
          Classical mechanics begins with the simple sentence that a body changes its motion when a force acts on it. The Newtonian picture turns this into
          $\mathbf{F}=m\mathbf{a}$ and then builds a toolkit for forces: springs, gravity, friction, contact. You can solve many problems with that alone,
          but the real depth appears when you step back and ask for a more universal viewpoint. Lagrangian mechanics says that instead of forces you should
          think in terms of a single scalar function $L=T-V$ and a principle of stationary action $S=\int L\,dt$. The path taken by the system is one that
          makes $S$ stationary with respect to small variations, which leads to the Euler–Lagrange equation
          $\dfrac{d}{dt}(\partial L/\partial \dot{q})-\partial L/\partial q=0$. This change of viewpoint is not just elegant. It lets you choose coordinates
          that match the symmetry of the problem, it makes constraints easy to handle, and it prepares your thinking for field theory and quantum mechanics.
          Hamiltonian mechanics goes further and rewrites the motion in terms of coordinates and conjugate momenta, with evolution generated by a single
          function $H$. The phase space flow preserves volume. The appearance of conserved quantities from symmetries is not a coincidence. It is the content
          of Noether’s theorem and is one of the deepest unifying ideas you will meet.
        </p>
        <div class="callout green">
          The shift from forces to actions is the first time you see how a new language can make old problems look obvious. The same logic will return in
          quantum theory, where dynamics are generated not by forces but by operators that act on states.

      <!-- Electromagnetism -->
      <article class="card span-12">
        <div class="badge">Fields</div>
        <h3>Electromagnetism: unity from symmetry</h3>
        <p>
          Electromagnetism is the first complete field theory most students encounter. Maxwell’s equations unite electricity, magnetism, and light in four
          compact relations. Written in differential form they say that electric charge is a source of field lines, magnetic field lines never begin or end,
          changing magnetic fields create electric fields, and changing electric fields create magnetic fields. The equations are consistent with special
          relativity and in fact help motivate it, since they pick out a universal speed $c$. The field viewpoint is not abstraction for its own sake.
          It explains radiation, interference, the behavior of circuits, waves in media, and the structure of atoms once quantum enters the story.
          When you learn to write electromagnetism in terms of a potential $A_\mu$ and a gauge symmetry, you are learning a pattern that extends to the
          standard model of particle physics. The idea that a redundancy in description (a gauge choice) can encode a physical long range force is one of
          the great surprises of modern physics and will return again when we talk about anomalies and the Higgs mechanism.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          If you have ever aligned a laser and watched fringes brighten and fade, you have touched Maxwell’s equations with your hands. Theory earns its keep
          when it gives names and rules to what your eyes already see.

      <!-- Relativity -->
      <article class="card span-12">
        <div class="badge">Geometry</div>
        <h3>Relativity: spacetime as a player</h3>
        <p>
          Special relativity is a statement about the symmetry of nature. All inertial observers see the same laws and the same speed of light. From that
          alone you discover that time and space mix, that simultaneity depends on motion, and that energy and mass are two faces of the same coin.
          General relativity moves from symmetry to geometry. Gravity is not a force that pulls over a distance. It is the curvature of spacetime produced
          by energy and momentum. Matter tells spacetime how to curve and curved spacetime tells matter how to move. The equations look compact
          $G_{\mu\nu}+ \Lambda g_{\mu\nu}=(8\pi G/c^4)T_{\mu\nu}$, but their content includes black holes, gravitational waves, the expansion of the universe,
          and the precise precession of Mercury. What is striking is how clean the assumptions are: local physics looks Minkowskian, motion follows geodesics,
          and the dynamics come from an action built from curvature scalars. Even if quantum gravity will someday modify these rules at small scales,
          the picture you learn here guides almost every conversation about the cosmos.
        </p>
        <div class="callout blue">
          The geometric lesson is practical: if you can identify a symmetry you can choose coordinates that make the physics transparent. Geometry is the
          art of picking the right view.

  <div class="wrap">
    <h2 class="section-title">Quantum mechanics: a patient introduction</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Quantum theory begins with a humble rule and a daring claim. The humble rule is that probabilities come from the squared magnitude of complex
      amplitudes. The daring claim is that before you record an outcome the system is not in one classical state or another. It is in a superposition
      that encodes possibilities and their phases. The mathematics is linear. The interpretation is subtle. We move slowly and do not mystify what can be said plainly.
    </p>

    <div class="grid">
      <article class="card span-12">
        <div class="badge">States</div>
        <h3>States and observables</h3>
        <p>
          A quantum state is represented by a vector $|\psi\rangle$ in a Hilbert space. An observable is represented by a Hermitian operator $\hat{A}$.
          If you measure $\hat{A}$ on the state $|\psi\rangle$, the only outcomes you can obtain are its eigenvalues, and the probability for a particular
          eigenvalue is set by the projection of $|\psi\rangle$ onto the corresponding eigenspace. This sounds abstract until you work a two level system.
          Let $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ be eigenstates of $\hat{\sigma}_z$. A general state is $|\psi\rangle=\alpha|0\rangle+\beta|1\rangle$ with
          $|\alpha|^2+|\beta|^2=1$. Measure $\hat{\sigma}_z$ and you see $+1$ with probability $|\alpha|^2$ and $-1$ with probability $|\beta|^2$.
          Between measurements the state evolves smoothly by the Schrödinger equation $i\hbar\,\partial_t|\psi\rangle=\hat{H}|\psi\rangle$.
          This split between smooth evolution and discrete outcomes is where much of the conceptual work of quantum foundations lives.

      <article class="card span-12">
        <div class="badge">Superposition</div>
        <h3>Interference and the meaning of a phase</h3>
        <p>
          Interference is not exotic. It is bookkeeping for how complex amplitudes add. If there are two indistinguishable paths with amplitudes
          $A$ and $B$, the total amplitude is $A+B$ and the probability is $|A+B|^2$. The cross term $A^\*B+B^\*A$ depends on their relative phase.
          Vary the path length and the phase changes, moving probability from one detector to another. Remove which path information and fringes return.
          Introduce which path information and fringes fade. The lesson is that information about alternatives destroys interference, not because knowledge
          has a magic power but because the full state, including the environment that holds the record, changes the amplitude structure.

        <div class="badge">Limits</div>
        <h3>Uncertainty and what it really says</h3>
        <p>
          Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation is often misdescribed as a statement about disturbance. The clean statement is about spreads in results across
          many identically prepared systems. For two observables $\hat{X}$ and $\hat{P}$ with commutator $[\hat{X},\hat{P}]=i\hbar$, the standard deviations
          obey $\Delta X\,\Delta P\ge \hbar/2$. This is a property of the state and the operators, not your hands shaking at the apparatus. The inequality
          explains why there is no physical state that is a delta function in both position and momentum. It does not say you cannot know anything. It tells
          you what combinations of knowledge the theory allows. That is a strength. It keeps us honest about claims.

      <article class="card span-12">
        <div class="badge">Entanglement</div>
        <h3>Entanglement and the shape of correlations</h3>
        <p>
          Entanglement is not mystic unity. It is the logical structure of states that cannot be written as products of parts. Consider the Bell state
          $(|00\rangle+|11\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$. Measure both qubits along the same axis and you see perfect correlations, yet each local outcome is random.
          Bell’s theorem shows that no local hidden variable model can reproduce the pattern of correlations for all chosen measurement axes. The experiments
          are clear. The correlations exceed the classical bound. What this rules out is a certain picture of pre existing local values. What it does not
          force is faster than light signaling. Quantum theory remains consistent with relativity. The puzzle is not a channel of communication. It is the
          structure of joint possibilities when you refuse to assign values that are not measured. When seen this way, the drama quiets and the principle
          comes forward: constraints on joint statistics are the heart of the matter.
        </p>
        <div class="callout blue">
          Entanglement is a resource. It powers quantum teleportation, super dense coding, and forms the fuel of error correction. The same structure that
          surprises our intuition becomes a tool once we learn to handle it with care.

      <article class="card span-12">
        <div class="badge">Measurement</div>
        <h3>The measurement problem and the menu of interpretations</h3>
        <p>
          The textbook split between unitary evolution and collapse is a rule for making predictions. It does not by itself tell a story about what the
          world is doing when nobody looks. Different interpretations propose different ontologies. The Copenhagen family is modest: the theory is a tool
          for assigning probabilities to outcomes of well defined experiments and we should not demand more. Many Worlds keeps only the unitary part and says
          that records of outcomes branch into non interfering histories; probabilities become branch weights. Pilot wave theory adds real particle positions
          guided by a wave that evolves by Schrödinger’s equation; the randomness comes from ignorance of initial conditions. Objective collapse models add a
          small physical mechanism that stochastically suppresses superpositions of macroscopically distinct states. Each view preserves the same empirical
          predictions for lab scale experiments so far, but they assign reality differently. You do not need to pick one to do physics. You do need to know
          that this is where the real conceptual work happens and why words like observer and measurement matter.

        <h3>Spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Higgs mechanism</h3>
        <p>
          A system can obey a symmetric law while choosing an asymmetric ground state. Imagine a ball balanced on top of a hill. The equations are rotationally
          symmetric but the resting place after a nudge points in one direction. In quantum field theory the vacuum can play the role of that resting place.
          When a field with a symmetric potential acquires a nonzero expectation value, the excitations around that state include massless modes (Goldstone
          bosons) for broken global symmetries and, if the symmetry is local (a gauge symmetry), the would be massless mode is absorbed to give mass to the
          gauge boson. That is the Higgs mechanism. It sounds technical because it is technical, but the picture is human. Laws can be simple while the world
          we inhabit is one particular choice among many allowed minima. The early universe likely passed through such transitions and left imprints we read
          today in particle masses and cosmic structure.

        <h3>Renormalization and why infinities are not the end</h3>
        <p>
          Quantum field theories often produce integrals that diverge if you try to include arbitrarily high energy virtual processes. At first glance this
          looks fatal. The repair is not a trick. It is a recognition that the parameters you call mass and charge depend on the energy scale at which you
          probe the system. You introduce a cutoff to keep track of what your theory can honestly claim and then you let parameters flow with scale in a way
          that preserves predictions for finite quantities. The renormalization group organizes that flow and explains universality: very different microscopic
          systems can show the same macroscopic behavior because details are washed out by scale. Once you grasp this you stop asking a theory to tell you
          more than it can know. You ask it to be predictive in its range and you look for a deeper theory if new scales become relevant.

        <h3>Gauge theories and anomalies</h3>
        <p>
          A gauge theory begins with a redundancy in description. You can transform your fields in a way that leaves observable quantities unchanged.
          That redundancy demands the existence of gauge fields that act like connections, telling you how to compare phases at different points. The
          interactions of the standard model are built on this spine. Sometimes quantum effects spoil a symmetry that exists at the classical level.
          That is an anomaly. Anomalies are not small mistakes. They are warnings that a theory will not be consistent unless charges and representations
          are arranged to cancel the offending terms, or unless new fields appear. This is less glamorous than black holes and more decisive. A theory that
          mishandles anomalies is not a candidate for the world.

        <h3>Berry phase and geometric phases</h3>
        <p>
          Not all phases come from time evolution. If a system’s parameters are slowly cycled around a closed loop, the state can pick up a geometric phase
          that depends only on the path in parameter space, not on the rate. This Berry phase shows up in polarization rotation, molecular spectra, and the
          quantum Hall effect. It is a clue that the space of states has curvature and that physical effects can be topological, insensitive to small
          deformations. Once you see this, band structure in solids looks like a field theory on a lattice of momenta, with Berry curvature shaping electron motion.

        <h3>Decoherence and decoherence free subspaces</h3>
        <p>
          Superpositions do not vanish when nobody looks. They become entangled with their environment. When you ignore the environment the reduced state of
          the system looks like a classical mixture because phase relations have leaked into correlations you do not track. This is decoherence. It explains
          why macroscopic objects appear classical without invoking a special role for consciousness. The same mechanism suggests a strategy for quantum
          computing: store information in subspaces that the dominant noise channels cannot touch. These decoherence free subspaces are not a slogan. They
          are a design principle for real devices and a reason error correction is more than wishful thinking.

      Quantum field theory treats particles as excitations of underlying fields. The vocabulary changes and so does the intuition. Interactions are encoded

        <p>
          The path integral formulation says that the amplitude for a process is a sum over all possible configurations, each weighted by $e^{iS/\hbar}$ where
          $S$ is the action of that configuration. In simple cases this sum reduces to the stationary phase approximation you met in classical mechanics:
          paths near stationary action contribute coherently and dominate. In field theory this becomes an integral over field configurations. Correlation
          functions that you compute with Feynman diagrams are moments of that integral. The diagrams are not tiny particles bouncing off each other.
          They are a bookkeeping device for terms in a series expansion. The picture is powerful because it connects symmetry to selection rules and makes
          renormalization a natural property of how integrals respond to scale.

          If you let a quantum field jiggle with all its modes, the lowest energy of the vacuum seems enormous. Gravity should feel that energy as a cosmological
          constant, curving the universe wildly. Observationally the cosmological constant is small but nonzero. The gap between naive quantum estimates and
          the measured value is sometimes called the worst prediction in physics. Many ideas have been proposed to explain it, from symmetries we have not seen
          to environmental selection in a multiverse. None is universally accepted. The honest stance is to track exactly what is measured, to be clear about
          the assumptions behind estimates, and to notice where the problem might be reshaped by a better understanding of gravity in the quantum regime.

        <h3>Topological phases and why order can be hidden</h3>
        <p>
          In ordinary phases of matter you recognize order by a local pattern: spins align, density waves form, bonds freeze. In topological phases the order
          is not local. It is encoded in global properties of the wavefunction, like winding numbers and Chern numbers. The quantum Hall effect and topological
          insulators are examples where edges carry protected modes that shrug at impurities. The protection comes from topology, not from energy barriers.
          This class of phases shows why phase diagrams are richer than a catalog of broken symmetries and why quantum information ideas and condensed matter
          ideas now share a border.

    <p class="lead">
      Information is not only a message in a notebook. It is a measurable, conserved like quantity with thermodynamic cost. Quantum mechanics turns this

          A qubit is any two level quantum system. Gates are unitary operations that rotate states and create entanglement. Measurement produces classical
          outcomes that guide later operations. Real devices are noisy so error correction is essential. The principle is to spread logical information across
          many physical qubits in a way that typical errors can be detected and reversed without learning the logical value itself. Threshold theorems show
          that if physical error rates are below a bound, arbitrarily long quantum computations are possible with enough overhead. This is an engineering
          challenge, not a loophole in the rules. The same mathematics that protects data in a lab protects ideas in black hole physics, where the bookkeeping
          of entropy and information becomes stark.

        <h3>Black hole information and holography</h3>
        <p>
          Black holes radiate with a thermal spectrum when quantum fields live on curved spacetime. If the radiation is purely thermal, information about the
          matter that formed the hole seems lost. Unitary evolution forbids that loss. The tension is the black hole information problem. A striking idea that
          reshapes the question is the holographic principle: the information content of a region can be described by degrees of freedom living on a lower
          dimensional boundary. In anti de Sitter space this becomes a duality between a quantum gravity theory in the bulk and a conformal field theory on
          the boundary (AdS/CFT). In that language black hole evaporation maps to a unitary process in the boundary theory, suggesting that information is not
          destroyed. The details are subtle and active research, but the broad lesson is clean. Geometry and quantum information are two ways of describing
          the same content. When ideas meet like that you are near something fundamental.

          In a crystal, electrons move in a periodic potential. Their allowed energies form bands. Near the bottom of a band the dispersion looks quadratic
          and you can treat excitations as free particles with an effective mass that differs from the bare electron mass. Interactions dress these carriers
          further into quasi particles that carry charge, spin, or heat. The marvel is that the huge complexity of $10^{23}$ electrons becomes a tractable
          story about a few collective modes once you identify the right variables. The renormalization group explains this washing out of microscopic detail
          and tells you which couplings matter at long distances. This is why a theorist can say honest things with a simple model.

          In the integer quantum Hall effect the Hall conductance is quantized in units of $e^2/h$. The steps are insanely precise and do not care about
          the details of impurities. The reason is topological. A Chern number computed from filled bands counts something like the winding of phases across
          the Brillouin zone and this integer cannot change without closing a gap. The boundary then carries chiral edge modes that cannot be localized by
          static disorder. This is a new kind of order, and it keeps showing up in materials and in ideas borrowed by quantum information, where topology can
          hide information from local noise.
