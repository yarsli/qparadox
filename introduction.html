        <h2>Quantum Mechanics</h2>
        <p>Quantum mechanics is the study of the universe on its smallest scales, a realm where the rules of everyday life begin to dissolve. At these scales, the behavior of matter and energy is governed by principles that seem strange compared to the familiar world we see around us. Particles can act like waves, waves can behave like particles, and a system can exist in multiple states at the same time. These are not guesses or speculative ideas. They are supported by decades of experiments that have been repeated, refined, and confirmed.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Wavefunction & Hilbert Space</h2>
        <p>The central object in quantum mechanics is the wavefunction, a mathematical description that contains everything that can be known about a system. It does not give a single definite answer to questions such as “Where is the particle?” or “What is its energy?” Instead, it describes all the possible answers and the probability of each one. The wavefunction exists in a structure called Hilbert space, which is an abstract arena that contains every possible state a system can be in.</p>
        <p>When a measurement is made, the wavefunction appears to “collapse” into a single outcome. Before the measurement, the system is described as a superposition of possibilities. The act of measuring changes this, producing one definite result from the range of possibilities described by the wavefunction. This change is not just an artifact of our instruments but is built into the way quantum systems behave.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Operators, Eigenstates & Uncertainty</h2>
        <p>Quantum mechanics also contains other features that are very different from classical physics. The uncertainty principle sets a limit on how precisely certain pairs of quantities, such as position and momentum, can be known. Entanglement creates correlations between particles that remain connected no matter how far apart they are. These are not simply oddities but key elements of the theory, with deep consequences for how we understand the nature of reality.</p>
        <p>The wavefunction contains the complete description of a system, but to extract specific information we need to apply the correct mathematical tools. These tools are called operators. An operator is a mathematical rule that acts on a wavefunction to give information about a measurable property, called an observable. Examples of observables include position, momentum, energy, and spin, each with its own operator. Applying an operator to a wavefunction allows us to find the possible results of a measurement and the probability of each result.</p>
        <p>Operators that represent observables have to be Hermitian, which guarantees that their eigenvalues — the possible measurement results — are real numbers. This requirement reflects the fact that measurement outcomes in experiments must be real physical values.</p>
        <p>When an operator acts on a wavefunction, it usually produces a different wavefunction. However, there are special cases where the wavefunction remains essentially the same except for being multiplied by a number. In these cases, the wavefunction is an eigenstate of the operator, and the number is the eigenvalue. Being in an eigenstate means that the system has a definite value for the corresponding observable.</p>
        <p>Some operators can be applied in any order without changing the result. In such cases, their observables can be measured simultaneously with full precision. Others do not commute, meaning the order of application affects the outcome. When this happens, the observables cannot be known exactly at the same time, which is one of the core reasons for the uncertainty principle.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Time Evolution & Schrödinger Equation</h2>
        <p>Quantum systems change with time, and this change is described by the Schrödinger equation. This equation tells us exactly how the wavefunction evolves, allowing us to predict its future form from its current state. The key object that drives this evolution is the Hamiltonian, the operator that represents the total energy of the system. It includes both kinetic and potential energy, and it determines how the wavefunction moves through Hilbert space as time passes.</p>
        <p>If the Hamiltonian is constant in time, the evolution of the system has a simple and elegant mathematical description. When the Hamiltonian changes, as when an external field is applied or a system interacts with its surroundings, the situation becomes more complex, but the same principles still apply. Time evolution is deterministic for the wavefunction itself, meaning we can calculate exactly how it changes. However, the results of specific measurements remain probabilistic. The Schrödinger equation governs the shifting landscape of probabilities that define what we can expect to see when we observe a quantum system.</p>
